        encourage fathers to take time off with young children.</li>

      <li>Provide 15 hours a week of free childcare to the parents of all two-year-olds in

      <li>Abandon the two-child policy on family benefits and abolish the Conservatives’

        of rape in order to access benefits.</li>

      <li>Reversing cuts to housing benefit for 18-21-year-olds and increase the rates of

        activity group.</li>

      <li>Increase Local Housing Allowance (LHA) in line with average rents in an area.</li>

      <li>Scrap the ‘bedroom tax’.</li>

      <li>Scrap the discredited Work Capability Assessment and replace it with a new

        world’ test that is based on the local labour market.</li>

      <li>Withdraw eligibility for the Winter Fuel Payment from pensioners who pay tax
        at the higher rate (40%).</li>
