    <li>Adopt a <code>Breathing Space</code> scheme so that somebody in problem debt can apply
      for legal protection from further interest, charges and enforcement action for
      up to 6 weeks.</li>

    <li>Promise to maintain the <code>Pensions Triple-Lock</code> until 2020. When it expires,
      introduce a new <code>Double-Lock</code>, meaning pensions will rise along with the earnings
      that pay for them or inline with inflation (whichever is highest).</li>

    <li>Ensure that state pension age reflects increases in life expectancy.</li>

    <li>The value of the family home will be taken into account along with other assets
      and income when means-testing for domiciliary care.</li>

    <li>Introduce a single capital floor, set at £100,000. No matter how large the cost
      of care turns out to be, people will always retain at least £100,000 of their
      savings and assets.</li>

    <li>Extend the current freedom to defer payments for residential care to those
      receiving care at home.</li>

    <li>Means-test winter fuel payments.</li>
